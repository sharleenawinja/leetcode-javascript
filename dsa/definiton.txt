Data structure =>  a data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively
The main idea behind data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities.
An efficient data structure takes minimum memory and requires minimum time to execute data

Time complexity => used to measure the amount of time required to execute code 
Space complexity => space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code 
Auxiliary space => the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure

Both time and space complexities are measured with respect to the input parameters.
But here arises a problem
The time required for executing code depends on several factors, such as:
    a. the number of operations being performed in the program
    b. the speed of the device, and also
    c. the speed of data transfered is being executed on an online platform
